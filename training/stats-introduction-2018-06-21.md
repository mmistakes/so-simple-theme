## Overview
This course provides a refresher on the foundations of statistical analysis. Practicals are conducted using the ‘Shiny’ package; which provides an accessible interface to the R statistical language.

Note that this is not a course for learning about the R statistical language itself. If you wish to learn more about R, please see other courses at the Sheffield Bioinformatics Core.

## Who should attend this course?


## Objectives:- After this course you should be able to:

- State the assumptions required for a one-sample and two-sample t-test and be able to interpret the results of such a test
- Know when to apply a paired or independent two-sample t-test
- To perform simple statistical calculations using the online app
- Understand the limitations of the tests taught within the course
- Know when more complex statistical methods are required


## Aims:- During this course you will learn about:

- Different types of data, distributions and structure within data
- Summary statistics for continuous and discrete data
- Formulating a null hypothesis
- Assumptions of one-sample and two-sample t-tests
- Interpreting the result of a statistical test
- Statistical tests of categorical variables (Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests)
- Non-parametric versions of one- and two-sample tests (Wilcoxon tests)



## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required, but those attending should be able to use a plain text editor.

## Instructors

- Mark Dunning, Bioinformatics Core Director
- to be confirmed
