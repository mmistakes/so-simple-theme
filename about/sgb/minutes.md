	- Full text: 
	
	  > "We will propose the following vote to Stan Developers Only group on Discourse the following:
	  > 
	  > Dear Stan Electorate,
	  > 
	  > TL;DR : The SGB wants a two (2) month extension to its operating authority. Vote here at https://heliosvoting.org/&lt;our vote&gt;
	  > 
	  > The members of 'Stan Development Team Only' are our current electorate for the SGB (Stan Governing Body). Last August we voted in a provisional SGB that would function for 1 year before another vote would be held. That vote is at:
	  > 
	  > https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/establishing-stan-governance/4295/42
	  > 
	  > We would like an additional two months of operating for the following reasons:
	  > 
	  > 1) A mid August election is not well suited to people's vacations.
	  > 
	  > 2) We don't want the election of SGB members to be rushed and an election August 23 seems too soon.
	  > 
	  > 3) The big reason is that we want to expand the electorate beyond what it is now. That will take some time, 2 months seems appropriate since we have to develop the idea further (by August 15), have a vote by 'Stan Development Team Only' expanding the electorate (Sept 1), and then get the new people into the electorate by the time of the SGB elections (October 23).
	  > 
	  > We encourage questions and of course voting at https://heliosvoting.org/<our vote> or by emailing vote@mc-stan.org but that will not be anonymous to our vote counter. You have one week to vote, deadline is midnight anywhere on the planet July 29.

	    > ### Abstract
	    > 
	    > Stan governance consists of the Stan community assembly and the Stan governing body.  The community assembly consists of active members of the the Stan community who have demonstrated a strong commitment to the project.  They are responsible for nominating new members as well as electing the new governing body each year.  The elected governing body in turn is responsible for managing the project and facilitating its success.
	    > 
	    > ### The Stan Community Assembly
	    > 
	    > #### Role
	    > 
	    > The community assembly is a group of trusted volunteers drawn from the Stan community that are eager to invest time and effort to cultivate the project.  These volunteers help to manage the development of the project and promotes it’s applied use through application, teaching, and research.  They elect the governing body that makes decisions that shape the future of the project and may participate in other roles required to achieve the project's goals, especially those that require a high level of trust. 
	    > 
	    > Community assembly members are expected to act as role models for the community and custodians of the project, on behalf of the active Stan community and all those who rely on Stan in their work.  In that role members of the community assembly may need to intervene, where necessary, in online discussions or at official Stan events on the occasions that a situation arises that requires mediation.
	    > 
	    > #### Responsibilities
	    > 
	    > In addition to fostering the community with their own work, community assembly members have three main responsibilities:
	    > 
	    > - Confirming candidates for membership in the community assembly
	    > - Participating in formal votes to elect a new governing body every year
	    > - Assisting members of the governing body in the management of the project
	    > 
	    > #### Membership
	    > 
	    > Ideal members of the community assembly demonstrate a good grasp of the philosophy of the Stan project, a solid track record of being constructive and helpful to other members of the community, significant contributions to the project's goals in any form, and willingness to dedicate some time to improving Stan.
	    > 
	    > An incomplete list of contributions that might be considered for membership in the community assembly include, in no particular order:
	    > 
	    > - Working on community management and outreach, such as hosting meet ups and conferences
	    > - Teaching and creating new educational material
	    > - Developing new statistical methodologies applicable to Stan
	    > - Demonstrating novel applications of Stan in science and industry
	    > - Providing support on the Stan Discourse Forum
	    > - Contributing code (new features, bug fixes, documentation, or tests)
	    > - Reviewing code
	    > - Participating in design discussions and decisions
	    > - Providing expertise in a particular domain applicable to the project
	    > - Managing Stan resources such as continuous integration infrastructure, the website, and the like.
	    > 
	    > Community assembly membership acknowledges sustained and valuable efforts that align with the philosophy and the goals of the Stan project.
	    > 
	    > The nomination process for prospective membership candidates proceeds in three phases:
	    > 
	    > Phase 1: A candidate is nominated by themselves or a current member of the community assembly by sending an email to candidate_inquiries@stan_assembly.googlegroups.com that describes the contributions of the candidate along with any supporting references that might be available.
	    > 
	    > Phase 2: For the week the nomination, current members may confirm by replying to the nomination email with the body “I confirm” if they feel that the candidate would be a benefit to the community assembly.  There are no explicit negative votes, but members may reply with constructive feedback for how the nominee could expand their contributions to achieve their confirmation in the future.
	    > 
	    > Phase 3: After one week the an election director selected by the governing body informs the candidate of the outcome.  Nominees receiving at least three confirmations are welcomed into the community assembly once they accept the Stan Code of Conduct. 
	    > 
	    > Community assembly members are always looking for promising contributors, teaching them how the project is structured and managed, and nominating them when they are interested in participating in the community assembly.
	    > 
	    > There is no time limit on community assembly membership.  Community assembly members who have stopped contributing, however, are encouraged to declare themselves as "inactive". Those who haven't made any non-trivial contribution in two years may be asked to move themselves to this category, and moved there if they don't respond.  While someone is in inactive status they lose their privilege to vote or nominate.
	    > 
	    > To record and honor their contributions, inactive team members will continue to be listed alongside active community assembly members; if they later resume contributions, they can switch back to active status at will. 
	    > 
	    > #### Ejecting community assembly members
	    > 
	    > In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to remove someone from the community assembly against their will, for example due to egregious and ongoing code of conduct violations.  This can be accomplished by a governing body vote, but unlike other governing body votes this requires the support of at least 2/3 of the governing body.

	    > 
	    > The current electorate is the Stan Development Team (https://discourse.mc-stan.org/g/Stan_Development_Team).

## 2019/09/26 (regular online meeting)

**Board Members**

* Present (6): Andrew Gelman, Breck Baldwin, Jonah Gabry, Sean Talts,
  Daniel Lee, Lizzie Wolkovich.

* Absent (2): Michael Betancourt, Julie Bertrand.

* Quorum present? Yes.

* Others present: None.


**Proceedings**

Meeting called to order at 12:30 PM by Presiding Officer, Breck Baldwin.

1. Meetings: our last meeting was Oct, 2018. We agreed to have more
   regular, shorter meetings.

2. SGB voting procedures. We recognized that there is a problem with
   our current online voting procedure. We will take it offline to try
   to fix it.

3. Stan Conference 2020.

	There are two potential hosts (that are still offering):

	1. Oregon State. Led by Yi Zhang and Debashis Mondal. Breck had a
       phone call with them.

	2. Utrecht. Led by Duco Veen and Matthijs Vákár. Breck has been in
       contact with them. They need an answer immediately on hosting
       StanCon 2020.

	We discussed the importance of StanCon to the community and it was
    clear that we feel that it is important that the SGB is
    responsible for having a good event each year. We should organize
    StanCon centrally with local organizers providing logistical
    support. Daniel Lee will take over communication from Breck
    Baldwin on StanCon and we will go forward with Oregon State for
    StanCon 2020.


4. Job descriptions. Andrew would like to involve Lauren Kennedy and
   Dan Simpson, members of the community that would help draft
   more-inclusive job descriptions for positions we are spending money
   for. The information procedure Andrew will follow is to draft job
   descriptions via email, then submit drafts to SGB.

5. TWG creation. We have not succeeded in creating a TWG yet. We
   identified that in our previous drafts we did not have enough focus
   on community leadership and focused instead on technical leadership
   and this needs to change. Breck's ask: look at the discourse
   thread. https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/twg-definition-roles-call-for-feedback-ideas-refinement/11094

6. Electorate discussion. We are trying to expand an electorate. Breck
   will email the SGB with the latest draft of proposed.


Meeting adjourned at 1:30.

Minutes submitted by Secretary, Daniel Lee.



## 2018/10/03 (regular online meeting)

**Board Members**

* Present (4): Breck Baldwin, Andrew Gelman, Lizzie Wolkovich, Daniel Simpson.

* Absent (5): Daniel Lee, Jonah Sol Gabry, Julie Bertrand, Michael Betancourt,
  Sean Talts.

* Quorum present? No.

* Others present: None

**Proceedings:**

All,

No quorum so I'll report it as informational which will be more
detailed than typical minutes.

1. There were some technical difficulties, so the meeting started a
little late.

2. TWG. We spoke about reaching out to the TWG for how to spend money and
some further direction on how to spend the funds that we have.

3. Discussion about the value of individual memberships. The feeling
was that the costs for whatever benefits we provided for membership
would not be cost effective as well. If people want to support Stan as
individuals they can buy a t-shirt.

4. Discussion about corporate memberships. Corporate memberships
perhaps make more sense. But again, what are the benefits? For $1k a
corp/university gets a few hours consulting, which in turn brings up
who has to support this. Maybe more like $10k for some quality time? A
dedicated email list for support. We discussed briefly adding tags to
Discourse discussions from "corp members" that gives them some
priority. Lots of issues around this. $20k gets you a 2-day course on
site?

5. I promised to get pricing on what a seat of SAS, SPSS, Strata
costs. We can mirror that pricing for a license for Stan for those who
desire to pay for Stan. Also the Gates foundation buys software for
their use.

6. We spoke of how to find successful OSS (Open Source Software) orgs
that made the transition we are trying to make. Julia and RStudio came
up. We spoke of how to address this information gathering goal.

  him later.

* Discussion on how to start the Technical Working Group (TWG). Tabled
  until Bob Carpenter is back in NYC. At a minimum, TWG needs to
  determine what budget it needs.

* Discussion on mission statement. There’s a tension between the two
  broad things we want to do:

    * Stan fits the hardest Bayesian models.
    * Stan is the programming language of Bayesian inference.

    We want to be accessible to bleeding edge computation and applied research. We want to support Stan’s technical development and wise use of Stan.

* Breck’s Executive Director report

    * Financials / NumFOCUS. Breck briefly discussed the NumFOCUS
      Summit that happened in NYC over the weekend. He’s been told
      that we will be able to directly invoice vendors, which should
      make working with NumFOCUS better.

    * Role. Discussion on role of the Executive Director. Two broad
      tasks Breck will do as the Executive Director: operating officer
      and building relationships.

  logo to be approved for now, but ask for adjustment if it was in
  violation of our policy. This secondary motion was withdrawn.

* 2018/09/24. Motion to create a Stan Logo policy. This is currently
  in discussion.

**Board Members**

* Present (5): Daniel Lee, Breck Baldwin, Julie Bertrand, Sean Talts, Dan Simpson.

* Absent (4): Andrew Gelman, Jonah Sol Gabry, Michael Betancourt,
  Lizzie Wolkovich.

* Quorum present? Yes.

* Others present: None


**Proceedings:**

* Meeting called to order at 12:05 PM Eastern by Acting Presiding
  Officer, Breck Baldwin.

* Noted that votes will only pass when it’s a simple majority of the
  full board (not a simple majority of those present).

* Breck reported on interactions with NumFOCUS. Currently, we are
unable to be issued a credit card. There are other options for
umbrella organizations and we may want to reconsider if NumFOCUS is
not able to handle finances for us in a satisfactory manner.

* **Motion (Vote #3):** Breck Baldwin nominated as presiding
    officer. Seconded and passed 5-0-4 (for, against, abstain
    (including absentees)).

* **Motion (Vote #4):** Move to set up 3 specific email accounts with
the “@mc-stan.org” domain: breck@mc-stan.org for Breck Baldwin to use
for Stan-related communication as executive director,
board@mc-stan.org for an external-facing inbound email address,
treasurer@mc-stan.org to go to the active treasurer (when we have
one). Brief discussion about which email addresses and whether Breck’s
email should be the role or the individual. Seconded and passed 5-0-4.
Todo: Daniel and Breck will set up the email addresses.

* Breck will send reports of his meetings with the different
  consultants. He will start prefacing reports with “Report” in the
  title.

* Breck will post a message to discourse announcing the Stan Governing
  Body to general. (It has been posted:
  https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/your-new-governing-body/5693)

* Everyone on the board should have write permissions to the
  website. Todo: Daniel will give write permissions to everyone on the
  board.

* **Motion (Vote #5):** Move to reject the request from Metrum
Research Group (Shona Kidd) to embed the Stan logo with a Torsten
logo. Discussion took place around whether it’s appropriate for any
project can embed the logo, the separation between official Stan
projects and unofficial ones, and that we would be ok with “powered by
Stan” as long as it doesn’t imply endorsement. The motion was seconded
and passed 5-0-4.  Todo: Breck will respond back to Shona Kidd stating
that we disapprove the use of the Stan logo as presented, but are ok
with a “powered by Stan” type of wording.

* Discussion on policy on inbound email. After board@mc-stan.org is
  set up, we will try to respond to each inbound email within 24
  hours, typically with template email. Anyone on the board is allowed
  to subscribe and share the responsibilities, but is not
  necessary. Initial volunteers: Breck, Daniel Lee, Daniel Simpson.

* Short discussion on funding. We discussed a number of things,
including paid licenses, focusing on recurring funding, and whether
this should be a committee. We decided this was important to the whole
board, so will have the email discussion with the whole board.  Todo:
Breck will send a summary message on what he’s thought about for
funding. We will continue the discussion with the whole board via
email.

* **Motion (Vote #6).** Motion to engage the two consultants we had as
    the committee: James Vasille (non-profit, board organization) and
    Kim Crayon (diversity). Seconded and failed 4-1-4. Quick
    discussion afterwards about describing the expected benefits from
    engaging with the consultants.

* Meeting adjourned at 12:55 PM Eastern.

* Minutes submitted by Board Member, Daniel Lee.
