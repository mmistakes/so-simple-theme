## Mission

MAGIC Grants focuses on building strong cryptocurrency communities and networks. From educational materials and scholarships that train, attract, and inspire talent, to security audits, development, and research for public payment infrastructure, MAGIC Grants empowers cryptocurrency communities in many ways.

MAGIC Grants does this through the direct efforts of the organization and through the semi-autonomous MAGIC Funds. This two-tier approach allows MAGIC Grants to focus on projects that support all cryptocurrency communities, while MAGIC Funds can provide more tailored attention and community engagement with specific communities and projects.

MAGIC Grants's mission is to continue improving the cryptocurrency ecosystem through various projects. MAGIc Grants supports essential payment infrastructure for the public good to lessen the burden of government.
