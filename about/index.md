With a strong passion for technology, I am always expanding my knowledge with the current trends and [**latest advancements**](http://www.dwavesys.com/quantum-computing) in the field. I believe that technology should be designed to work with us, and fit unobtrusively into our lives and the natural world. With this dream I aim to [**change the world**](https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_better_tech_could_protect_us_from_distraction), now all I need is its source code!
