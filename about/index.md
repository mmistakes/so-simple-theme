Hi, I‚Äôm Sergey and I‚Äôm a web-developer. I am really in love with web technologies and services.

Primary language is [PHP](/tags/#php) but also I have well experience with JavaScript using libraries React, ReactNative. I have developed server applications using frameworks such as Laravel, Yii2, Slim. Also I have developed websites using differenct CMS such as [WordPress](/tags/#wordpress), MODx, Drupal but most of all I love [WordPress](/tags/#wordpress).

Another passion is development and deployment automatization. I have deployed a number of applications from scratch on DigitalOcean and AWS infrastructures.
I work with [Terraform](/tags/#terraform) to automate and to speed up any kind of service deployment. I use Fastlane to automate mobile builds and to deliver staging versions.

I love [Docker](/tags/#docker), just love. If there any chance to apply it to help with software deployments, and code delivery - I do it.
