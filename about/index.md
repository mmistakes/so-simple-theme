Hi there - we are Franzi and Nynne! The Rubyherzlein blog is documenting our adventures as we learn to program with Ruby on Rails. This summer we are participating in the Rails Girls Summer of Code. Our team 'Rubyherzlein' will be focusing on developing the SoundDrop app! (Rubyherzlein is German for 'little Ruby heart').

So -what is Rails Girls Summer of Code, you ask? In 2010 Finish developers Linda Liukas and Karri Saarinen  started the first Rails Girls workshops, which taught Ruby on Rails to women. Since then, the Rails Girls movement has spread to most continents. Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC), is a three month program that supports women who are learning Ruby on Rails, initiated by the Rails Girls community. 

Want to know more about Ruby on Rails? You've come to the right place! Over the course of the next 4 months, we will document everything we learn and share it on the blog.
