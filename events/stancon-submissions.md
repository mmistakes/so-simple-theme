StanCon's version of conference proceedings will be a collection of contributed
talks based on interactive, self-contained notebooks (e.g., knitr, R Markdown,
Jupyter, etc.). Anyone using Stan is welcome to submit a contributed talk. For
example, you might demonstrate a novel modeling technique, or a (possibly
simplified version of a) novel application, etc. There is no minimum or maximum
length.

Submissions will be peer reviewed by the Stan Development Team and all accepted
notebooks will be published in an official StanCon repository. If your
submission is accepted we may ask you to present during one of the StanCon
sessions. Some presentations will be short (in the 10-20 minute range) and one
or two will be for a full session (about an hour).

### Submission contents

Each submission should include:

* the notebook
* separate files containing the Stan program, data, initializations if used, etc.
* a permissive license for everything such as [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

Please take care to ensure that your notebook runs out of the box, otherwise we
cannot guarantee full consideration.

### Deadline

December 1st, 2016

### How to submit

Please email all submissions and questions about submissions to
