Manual
======

Stan is based on a probabilistic programming language for
specifying models in terms of probability distributions.  Stan's
modeling language is is portable across all interfaces (PyStan,
RStan, CmdStan).

The modeling language manual is released under the most
accomodating of the Creative Commons licenses,
[CC BY (v3)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

The modeling language manual contains a guide to programming
in Stan with example models, a reference manual for the language
itself, and a reference guide to the built-in special functions and
probability functions.

Examples
========

The quick start guides for each [interface](/interfaces/) contain some
example models that illustrate how to run Stan.

The modeling language manual contains other examples of model to
illustrate coding techniques in Stan.

A larger set of example models translating the BUGS examples
(Volumes 1 through 3) and the models described in Gelman and Hill's
multilevel regression book are available:

Tutorials
=========

Here we've compiled a partial list of tutorials for Stan, its interfaces,
and its underlying technologies, in addition to our manual and examples.  
If you find more tutorials, let us know and we'll list them.
