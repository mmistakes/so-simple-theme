Stan<sup>&reg;</sup> is a state-of-the-art platform for statistical modeling
and high-performance statistical computation.  Thousands of users rely
on Stan for statistical modeling, data analysis, and prediction in
the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, and
business.

Users specify log density functions in Stan's probabilistic
programming language and get:

* full Bayesian statistical inference with MCMC sampling <span
class="note">(NUTS, HMC)</span>

* approximate Bayesian inference with variational inference <span
class="note">(ADVI)</span>

* penalized maximum likelihood estimation with optimization <span
class="note">(L-BFGS)</span>

Stan's math library provides differentiable probability functions
&amp; linear algebra <span class="note">(C++ autodiff)</span>.
Additional R packages provide expression-based linear modeling,
posterior visualization, and leave-one-out cross-validation.

## Get Started

Stan interfaces with the most popular data analysis languages <span
class="note">(R, Python, shell, MATLAB, Julia, Stata)</span> and runs
on all major platforms <span class="note">(Linux, Mac,
Windows)</span>.

To get started using Stan begin with the [Users](/users/) page or
you can use Stan without any additional configuration via
[RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/56157)
