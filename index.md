# _A new, free network_

What if any computer in New York City could connect to any other computer, for free?

The Internet is lovely and all, but it's designed in such a way that we have to pay Internet Service Providers for access each month. And that can get real expensive, real fast.

# _How do we make this happen?_

By using what are essentially high-powered wireless routers, anyone within several miles of someone on the network can join.

Moreover, routing and other technical details involved in running this kind of network are handled by building the network on top of the [CJDNS](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) software. This has the added benefit of keeping all our communication secure as well.
