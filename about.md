**Bangalore Bytes** is an amalgamation of how we breath and feel in our Namma City. It’s our collection of recipes that myself (Preeti) and my spouse (Ramesh) have woven together.

My recipes are food centric which is my and my spouses’ love, and my spouses’ recipes are tech centric which is his passion.

## So Simply it’s all about ourselves

It’s always fun to share passion because it provides energy to continue and enhance, so that’s the chief reason that myself and my husband decided to start this blog. We will try to bring forward what we love about Namma City, we are by no means comprehensive but none-the-less we will have engaging stuff for you all.

**So sit back and have fun**
