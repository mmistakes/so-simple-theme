<!-- Over the years I've temp’d, schlepped, acted, composed, programmed, authored, bounced folks at the <a href="http://greenmilljazz.com/">Green Mill</a>, consulted, facilitated, designed, led, played guitar at <a href="http://www.metrochicago.com/">Metro</a>, spoken, taught, mentored, and learned. Locally, nationally, internationally. All day, baby!</p>

<p>As a leader of a history-making, groundbreaking technology team I helped re-elect President Obama. I’ve been part of startups for twenty years, including early stints at Orbitz and Groupon, though that’s a long story. I've worked with orgs like the Field Museum of Natural History, IBM, Lockheed Martin, the Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, and Threadless, and spoken at BAYCHI, Google, IIT’s Institute of Design, UXWeek, and Xerox PARC. I've been invited to <a href="http://www.caldronfallsbarandgrill.com/hogwrestling1.html">pig wrestle in Athelstane</a>, but to date I've graciously declined.</p>

<p>I’ll never make a 40 under 40 list, but like my heroes Robert Frost and Vince Lombardi, I’m okay with that.</p>

<p>In a long and varied career, I've been fortunate to work with great organizations including the Field Museum, Groupon, IBM, LeapFrog, the Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, Orbitz, Threadless, and more. I've spoken at BAYCHI, Google, the Institute of Design, UXWeek, at Xerox PARC, and tons of local meetups. I've been an adjunct faculty member at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and DePaul University.</p>
