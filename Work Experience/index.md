**Barnett Machine Tool, Harrison, NJ (September 2015 - March 2017 )**
   
   * At Barnet Machine Tool, I had the opportunity to work with a great teamwork, which gave me the possibilities to              improve my skills in this industry and be a better professional. One of my main task as a worker in Barnett was the          complete set up of a Haas VF-3 and a Toshiba BP-13P40 from using the right tools to machined the part, to inspected the      part once was finished, using precision instruments like micrometer, caliper, and gauges.
