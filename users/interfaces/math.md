  </p>

The library is no longer entirely header only and depends on both the
Sundials differential equation solving library and the Intel Thread
Building Blocks library.


# Documentation and Getting Started

A simple getting-started example for computing derivatives is provided
in the

* <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/math/blob/develop/README.md">Stan Math
    Library README</a>.
  </p>

There is a make target to build the API documentation using
[doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) <span
class="note">(Doxygen)</span>.

Computing gradients of C++ functions is documented in the [arXiv
paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07164) <span
class="note">(arXiv)</span>.


# Unit Testing

Unit tests aim to cover all of the library functionality.
