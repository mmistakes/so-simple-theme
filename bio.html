<p>Over the years I've temp’d, schlepped, composed, programmed, authored, bounced folks at the <a href="http://greenmilljazz.com/">Green Mill</a>, consulted, acted, facilitated, designed, led, played guitar at <a href="http://www.metrochicago.com/">Metro</a>, spoken, taught, mentored, and learned. You can divide my career into four broad categories:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Startups</dt>
	<dd>As a leader of the history-making, ground-breaking technology team I helped re-elect President Obama. I’ve been working in technology startups for twenty years, including early stints at <a href="http://orbitz.com/">Orbitz</a>, The Point (which grew up to be <a href="http://groupon.com/">Groupon</a>, though that’s a long story), and co-founding and leading <a href="http://fuzzymath.com/">Fuzzy Math</a>. I am now the co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://publicgoodsoftware.com/">Public Good Software</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Consulting</dt>
	<dd>I've been fortunate to work with great organizations including the Field Museum of Natural History, IBM, Lockheed Martin, the Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, and Threadless.</dd>
	<dt>Speaking</dt>
	<dd>I've spoken at BAYCHI, Google, IIT’s Institute of Design, UXWeek, Xerox PARC, and lots of local meetups and national conferences.</dd>
	<dt>Teaching</dt>
	<dd>I've been an adjunct faculty member at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and DePaul University.</dd>
</dl>

<p>I've been invited to <a href="http://www.caldronfallsbarandgrill.com/hogwrestling1.html">pig wrestle in Athelstane</a>, but to date I've graciously declined.</p>

<p>I’ll never make a 40 under 40 list, but like my heroes Robert Frost and Vince Lombardi, I’m okay with that.</p>
