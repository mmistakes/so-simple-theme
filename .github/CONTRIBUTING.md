# Contributing

Found a typo in the documentation? Requesting a feature or
[bug fix][issues]? Search through the open and closed issues before [submitting an issue][new-issue] to avoid duplication. 

[Pull requests][using-pull-requests] are also appreciated. If this is your first time, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow][github-flow].

If your contribution adds or changes the theme's behavior, make sure to update the documentation and/or sample content. Documentation lives in README.md while sample posts, pages, and collections are in the [`docs`](docs) and [`example`](example) folders.

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g.
   `my-awesome-new-feature`).
3. Open a pull request on GitHub and describe what problem it solves.
