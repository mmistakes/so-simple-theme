  Before opening a new issue please:
  
  - Verify you have the latest versions of Jekyll and So Simple 
    installed by running `bundle update`.

    https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme
  - Search all issues at https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/issues

## Environment

<!--
  Please include theme version, Jekyll version, public git repository, whether 
  you are hosting with GitHub Pages, and the operating system you tested with.

  Issues without a link to a public repository or ZIP file will likely go ignored.
  Being able to see your actual files is necessary to troubleshoot, as most 
  issues stem from invalid/missing YAML Front Matter, a mis-configured _config.sys 
  file, or problematic site content.

- So Simple version:
- Ruby gem or remote theme version:
- Jekyll version:
- Git repository URL:
- GitHub Pages hosted (if yes provide URL to site):
- Operating system:

## Expected behavior

<!--
  What is it you expected to happen? This should be a description of how the
  functionality you tried to use is supposed to work.

## Steps to reproduce the behavior

<!--
  Describe the steps you took for this problem to exist. Such as: you installed
  the theme, customized _config.yml, added your own posts, and started up a 
  Jekyll server locally.

  If an error occurred on GitHub Pages when pushing, please test a local version
  following these setup instructions: 
  https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/

  Then provide a complete log by running `bundle exec jekyll build --trace --verbose` 
  and include this output in the filed issue.

  Screenshots can also be included if they help illustrate a behavior.
