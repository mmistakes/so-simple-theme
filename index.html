<p>I've been in a lover's quarrel with <span>technology</span> ever since I saw an Apple ][ in a second grade classroom. I brought home the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK9VU1aJvTI">wonder computer of the 1980s</a> a few years later.</p>
<p>You can find me at the intersection of people and technology, advocating for elegant, simple solutions to gnarly problems. Most recently, I was privileged to serve as the director of user experience for Obama for America. I am the CEO of <a href="https://publicgoodsoftware.com/">Public Good Software</a>, an adjunct at the <a href="http://www.starterschool.com/">Starter School</a>, a mentor at <a href="http://theimpactengine.com/">Impact Engine</a>, and an advisor at the <a href="http://admci.org/">ADMCi</a> and <a href="http://www.ux4good.com/">UX for Good</a>.</p>

<p>My resolution for 2014 is to complete as many of the <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/programs/saguaro/about-social-capital/what-you-can-do">144 social capital building tasks</a> described by Harvardâ€™s Kennedy School and blog about it here.</p>

<!-- <p>I'm more outgoing than Salinger, less evil than Boss Hogg, making me a decent JD.</p> -->
