		<p>Now, I am handcrafting technology for civil society with <a href="https://publicgoodsoftware.com/">Public Good Software</a> &amp; counting my lucky stars.</p>

<p>I’ve earned a living as a bouncer, waiter, cook, salesperson, musician, consultant, computer programmer, legislative analyst, and as a lowly executive.</p>
 -->
<p>I've been in a lover's quarrel with <span>technology</span> ever since I saw an Apple ][ in a second grade classroom. I brought home the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK9VU1aJvTI">wonder computer of the 1980s</a> a few years later. <!-- Over the years I've temp’d, schlepped, acted, composed, programmed, authored, bounced folks at the <a href="http://greenmilljazz.com/">Green Mill</a>, consulted, facilitated, designed, led, played guitar at <a href="http://www.metrochicago.com/">Metro</a>, spoken, taught, mentored, and learned. Locally, nationally, internationally. All day, baby!</p>

<p>As a leader of a history-making, groundbreaking technology team I helped re-elect President Obama. I’ve been part of startups for twenty years, including early stints at Orbitz and Groupon, though that’s a long story. I've worked with orgs like the Field Museum of Natural History, IBM, Lockheed Martin, the Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, and Threadless, and spoken at BAYCHI, Google, IIT’s Institute of Design, UXWeek, and Xerox PARC. I've been invited to <a href="http://www.caldronfallsbarandgrill.com/hogwrestling1.html">pig wrestle in Athelstane</a>, but to date I've graciously declined.</p>

<p>I’ll never make a 40 under 40 list, but like my heroes Robert Frost and Vince Lombardi, I’m okay with that.</p>

In a long and varied career, I've been fortunate to work with great organizations including the Field Museum, Groupon, IBM, LeapFrog, the Mayo Clinic, Microsoft, Orbitz, Threadless, and more. I've spoken at BAYCHI, Google, the Institute of Design, UXWeek, at Xerox PARC, and tons of local meetups. I've been an adjunct faculty member at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and DePaul University.</p>

<p>You can find me at the intersection of people and technology, advocating for elegant, simple solutions to gnarly problems. Most recently, I was privileged to serve as the director of user experience for Obama for America. I am the CEO of <a href="https://publicgoodsoftware.com/">Public Good Software</a>, an adjunct at the <a href="http://www.starterschool.com/">Starter School</a>, a mentor at <a href="http://theimpactengine.com/">Impact Engine</a>, and an advisor at the <a href="http://admci.org/">ADMCi</a> and <a href="http://www.ux4good.com/">UX for Good</a>.</p>

<p>My resolution for 2014 is to complete as many of the <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/programs/saguaro/about-social-capital/what-you-can-do">144 social capital building tasks</a> described by Harvard’s Kennedy School and blog about it here.</p>

<!-- <p>I'm more outgoing than Salinger, less evil than Boss Hogg, making me a decent JD.</p> -->
