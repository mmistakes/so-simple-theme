<p>This website is brought to you by Jason Kunesh with design help from <a href="http://aaronsalmon.com/">Aaron Salmon</a>. It is powered by the lightweight content management system <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> and uses a modified version of the <a href="http://mademistakes.com/">So Simple Theme</a> to provide visual treatments. In an alternative universe I would have used <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> because <a href="http://ma.tt/">Matt Mullenweg</a> is an amazing human being.</p>

<p>The photographic design elements are from a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jdkunesh/sets/72157624809611481/">series of photos</a> I took <em>on film</em> in <a href="http://www.marinette.wi.us/">Marinette, Wisconsin</a> 20 years ago. This site was handcoded using <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text Editor</a>, the way <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTweetOfGod">God</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timberners_lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> intended.</p>
