Much has happened in the past few months. We now have our first public node at d.b.a bar in the East Village- SSID:nycmesh.net dba. Very recently we installed three more nodes bringing the active node count to six- Brian, dba, Sam, Winston, Jaclyn and Oliver. All of these are in the East Village or Lower East Side. A group from Parsons (The New School for Design) will soon be adding another eight nodes near Union Square.

Our meetings have returned to our regular Sunday schedule. Also we've been having meetings with other mesh related local projects during the week, such as [Red Hook WiFi](http://rhicenter.org/redhookwifi/) and [GOLES](http://goles.org/) (who work with [WiFi-NY](https://wifiny.net/)). Please join our [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/nycmesh/) to find out about all of our meetings.

Lately we've been making most of our plans on [#slack](https://nycmesh.slack.com). Please join if you'd like to get involved!
