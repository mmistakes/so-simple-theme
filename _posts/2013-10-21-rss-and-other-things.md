I finally got RSS to work on the site, along with a few other under the hood improvements.

To point the RSS to your favourite Google Reader replacement, please go to the menu bar at the top -> RSS. Or point it directly to http://abijango.com/feed if you want.

I have some further enhancements in the pipeline, which will be rolling out sooner or later.
