I am getting a lot of personal one-to-one feedback on the posts which is great. Just to remind you, if you want to shout at me, argue, or just have a plain discussion, all the links are in the About section. Top menu -> About.

I do reply to emails etc. but by far the best place to have a discussion is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abijango).

You can follow the author or shout at him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/abijango)
