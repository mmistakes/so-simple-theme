## Summary of Week 1

### GitHub & Git
On wednesday we had our first Rails Girls Summer of Code day at the SoundCloud HQ in Berlin! Here are some of the things we learned in our first week. 

GitHub is web-based git repository hosting service. Its a platform that allows programmers to upload their code, share it and work on it collaboratively (also known as source code management, SCM). Its more than a storage space for code, though: it's also a social platform where you get to share your projects and see what your friends and colleagues are working on, in other words it is absolutely instrumental for open source projects.

GitHub's logo is the Octocat. If you do a google image search for "octocat" you'll actually get a pretty good sense of just how beloved this hosting service is among programmers. All those decked-out cats/memes were made by members of this huge community that celebrates the open-source culture. When starting out as a programmer, it therefore makes perfect sense that getting into GitHub is the right place for us to start our summer project.

My initial thought on GitHub was that it reminds me of the edit function in google docs that allows you to share the editing process with someone working remotely. But this kind of metaphor soon became inadequate as we learned just how many quirks and particulars are involved when the material being shared and edited is code!

To use Github, first of all, you need to use the distributed revision control system called Git. A what now? A distributed revision control system is a tool that enables the sharing of code. The brilliance of the Git/GitHub system can really be found in the way it allows its users to share, save and easily access earlier versions of the program they are working on. Each developer has their own full copy of a repository, and it’s easy to share changes with any other repositories. However, when you are collaborating on a project, it’s useful to have a single, central repository which is always available, and accessible from anywhere. With GitHub nothing will ever be lost with your revisions! In practical reality, every version of the program you're working on will be available because all the additions you make to the program are like branches that shoot from a tree. Like so:

The trick with using Git and Github is to keep track of the complex 'tree' of your code and the different versions that are created along the way, ie. the branches. This is of course made slightly more complex when you collaborate with one or more people on the same code! 

So we learned that GitHub is the online hosting service for our repositories and that Git is the tool we use to push them up there. The first thing we needed to do after we had installed Git and played a bit around with its functions was to use it to clone a remote repository -the SoundDrop repository that we will be working on this summer!

Cloning which means to downloads a repository from github to your own computer, looks like this in the terminal:

git clone <url>


Here are a couple of other useful Git commands:

git status command: says if there are any changes / updates you want to push to git.

git div shows the actual changes

git add: you can add multiple changes separately

git commit: finalize your changes in your local setting
adds everything that you changed as a package.
when you commit you can type -n “any message goes here about what you changed”
and then it's a little message about that commit for reference.

git log: shows all the commits

git push: finalize your changes in online. Pushing your changes to be online

git dif: shows every work-in-progress change

git reset: to go back revert back or reverse actions!
