## Summary of Week 1

### GitHub & Git
On wednesday we had our first Rails Girls Summer of Code day at the SoundCloud HQ in Berlin! Our first week was all about GitHub & Git!

GitHub is web-based git repository hosting service. Its a platform that allows programmers to upload their code, share it and work on it collaboratively (also known as source code management, SCM). Its more than a storage space for code, though: it's also a social platform where you get to share your projects and see what your friends and colleagues are working on, in other words it is absolutely instrumental for open source projects. 

GitHub's logo is the Octocat. If you do a google image search for "octocat" you'll actually get a pretty good sense of just how beloved this hosting service is among programmers. All those decked-out cats/memes were made by members of this huge community that celebrates the open-source culture.

At first GitHub reminded me of the edit function in google docs that allows you to share the editing process with someone working remotely. But this metaphor soon became inadequate as we learned just how many quirks and particulars are involved when the material being shared and edited is code!

To use Github, first of all, you need to use the distributed revision control system called Git. A what now? Git is a tool that enables the sharing of code. The brilliance of the Git/GitHub system can really be found in the way it allows its users to share, save and easily access earlier versions of the program they are working on. With GitHub nothing will ever be lost with your revisions! Every version (repository) of the program you're working on will be available because all additions are like branches that shoot from a tree. Like so:

The trick with using Git and Github is to keep track of the complex 'tree' of your code and the different versions that are created along the way, ie. the branches. The first thing we needed to do after we had installed Git and played a bit around with its functions was to use it to clone a remote repository -the SoundDrop repository that we will be working on this summer!

What we learned is that when working on an open source project, setting up shop means to clone a depository and work on it locally on your computer and then push your changes to the shared GirHub project account.

In the links section you'll find all the tutorials we used to familiarize ourselves with using GitHub and Git, including resources for learning commands for Vim -an editor that is used with Git.
