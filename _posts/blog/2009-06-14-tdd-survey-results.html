<p>I gave a lightning talk at RubyNation called &ldquo;TDD in the real world&rdquo;, mostly as an excuse to poll the audience about testing practices. </p>
<p>The most interesting question for me was - how many people follow the standard &ldquo;red, green, refactor&rdquo; cycle in their day to day development? I asked - who follows this pattern more than half the time? 70% of the time? 100% of the time? Results:</p>
<ul><li>50% - about half the audience.</li>
<li>70% - ~40% of the audience (I&rsquo;m in this category)</li>
<li>100% - 5 and a half people, including Yehuda Katz</li>
</ul><p>A lot of people are not doing strict TDD. This is the RubyNation conference, which had <a title="TATFT">TATFT</a> last year. This is the Ruby community, which has a ton of experimentation and a million test frameworks. Frankly, I&rsquo;m kind of baffled. Are these people doing a lot of research-style code spikes? Are they writing tests after the code, but still getting decent test coverage? Or is testing just &ldquo;exercise and vegetables&rdquo; - things that people should be doing, but don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>More research is needed.</p>
