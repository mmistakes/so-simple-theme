We are excited that our campaign to raise funds for Dr. Sarang Noether to implement Bulletproofs+ in Monero was successful! We raised $5,132 from 26 donors.

[Link to the campaign](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/dr-sarang-noether-to-implement-bulletproofs-in-monero)

This project funding proposal includes:

* Computer code for the Bulletproofs+ prover and verifier algorithms, written for compatibility with the Monero open-source code base

* Performance and unit test computer code

* All code released under a permissive open source license

The campaign does NOT include an audit of the code, which would be required before the code is used in Monero.

MAGIC Grants selected GoFundMe Charity for this fundraising campaign.
