## Keep on Keeping on


![Dunning-Kruger Effect](/images/dunning-kruger-effect.jpg)


Yesterday we talked with our coach about the learning process with Rails Girls Summer of Code. Erik reminded us of the Dunning-Kruger Effect, which explains how beginners have the most confidence because thet lack experience. In this model experience = understanding that there is so much more to learn which again results in a loss of confidence. The downward going curve continues untill a certain level of experience is attained, by which point the curve starts to go up again, although it never reaver reaches the same high as it started on. Experts may feel confident in their knowledge base, after having spent years and years building it up, but are still more aware of their shortcomings than a beginner. 

The model is useful because it explains why our Rails Girls Summer of Code project can feel like a bumpy ride at times. Our hacksession with the whole SoundDrop group yesterday was a good example of this. In order to get the SoundDrop app to run locally on our computers, we ended up taking a sizable detour to install various things and reconfigure Ruby versions! As a beginner, it feels like every simple step of the way can lead to a rabbit hole of troubleshooting that leads to yet more questions and searches for solutions! 

The real quality of the Rails Girls Summer of Code program is that we have this super supportive network consisting of our coach, mentors, and supervisor, not to mention all the other guides from the SoundCloud office who are generously offering their support.
