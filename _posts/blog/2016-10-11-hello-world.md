Hello friends. This is a new blog I am cooking up. It is titled: "What Did I Learn Today?"

I often joked with coworkers of creating a chat line in our group messaging system "slack" called "What Did I Learn Today?" This channel would be little snippets of the gotchas and cool tricks that one learns while doing software development. There doesn't seem to be a day that goes by where I don't have at least one nugget of information worth sharing with the team. This blog idea sort of spawned from that.

As people who meet me will often hear me saw, "I am kind of a hobbyist." I say this because I think it is easier to understand than to say what I actually think of myself, a learner-a life-long learner.

I use the word learner intentionally over the word student. When I think of a student I think of a specific kind of learning: a relationship with a teacher, having a curriculum and of institutions of learning such as schools or universities. This learning I speak of is not that.

I am speaking of learning just for the joy of acquiring new information and skills, and the greater joy of passing it to others.  

This blog is dedicated to that pursuit of knowledge and that part of myself.

Each post will have a topic (and presumably these topics fall into categories or different even series). My goal will be to learn this top well enough to teach it to you, my good reader, in a concise manner. Neither you nor I will walk away knowing the topic inside and out more likely than not, but I will at least provide a starting point, and some suggested continued reading or resources.

My articles will have the following sections. (Usually. I can't promise total consistency.)
-TL;DR. The absolute bare minimum you need to know.
-A Fuller Introduction
-The Nitty Gritty
-More More More (Resources for Continued Learning)

I never count a day as truly good unless I learned something. Maybe it's about work, something sciency, some new line on the piano, maybe even something about myself.

In the spirit of this I will also post smaller quick tweet style (usually longer than a tweet, as you may already be able to tell, I am fairly long winded.) learnings in the "Daily" section. Warning in advance, these will probably be related to software development a lot, because that is how I spend a lot of my time.

I also anticipate putting a lot quotes of smart or funny (or better yet both) people in this section. (That thesaurus of quotes I bought for myself might finally get some more practical use other than entertaining me while I sit on the toilet.)

The blog section will be perhaps meta posts about learning, reflections on what I am learning, or well quite frankly whatever else I feel like putting there. Who knows. A little mystery in life is a good thing.

It will not over lap with the blog that I have going on over at www.jacksonjhayes.com which is mostly a travel blog / journal style blog.

I'd like to think I have up to this point in life learned a thing or two. So I, without having to go off and learn something new,  I will offer up my first topic. Learning 0. This will hopefully give you a taste of what a post on here might look like.

I will attempt in this post to demystify software development ("programming") to the lay person and walk you through writing your first small application. I hope to prove to you that it is something that anyone can learn. Then I will point you in the direction of resources to continue your learning if you feel so inspired.

Without further ado: Introduction to Programming (Using C#)

Thanks for learning with me.
Jackson
