<p>Six days shall thou hack, and deliver all thy features;</p>
<p>but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Quality of thy Code; in it thou shall not deliver any business value, nor thy tester, nor thy project manager, thy senior developer nor thy junior developer, nor any consultant or contractor that is within thy company.</p>
