<p>Just published a new gem for my day job: <a href="https://github.com/asee/mixable_engines">Mixable Engines</a>.</p>

<p>In the beginning, there was the engines plugin.  This was back before Rails 2.3, when men were men and there was no &ldquo;engines&rdquo; functionality built into rails.  The plugin would mix together the controller classes from your engines and your application.  </p>
<p>In those days, my colleagues and I at the ASEE wrote lots of engines, and lots of apps that used those engines, and all of it depending on this mixed-together architecture.  Now as we upgrade our apps to Rails 3, this gem allows us to keep the existing code and engines working without rewriting everything. </p>
