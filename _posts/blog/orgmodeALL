Org mode supports insertion of empty structural elements (like #+BEGIN_SRC and #+END_SRC pairs) with just a few key strokes. This is achieved through a native template expansion mechanism. Note that Emacs has several other template mechanisms which could be used in a similar way, for example yasnippet.

To insert a structural element, type a ‘<’, followed by a template selector and <TAB>. Completion takes effect only when the above keystrokes are typed on a line by itself.

The following template selectors are currently supported.

| s | #+BEGIN_SRC ... #+END_SRC       |
| v | #+BEGIN_VERSE ... #+END_VERSE   |
| c | #+BEGIN_CENTER ... #+END_CENTER |
| l | #+BEGIN_LaTeX ... #+END_LaTeX   |
| L | #+LaTeX:                        |
| h | #+BEGIN_HTML ... #+END_HTML     |
| H | #+HTML:                         |
| a | #+BEGIN_ASCII ... #+END_ASCII   |
| A | #+ASCII:                        |
| i | #+INDEX: line                   |
| I | #+INCLUDE: line                 |

For example, on an empty line, typing "<e" and then pressing TAB, will expand into a complete EXAMPLE template.

You can install additional templates by customizing the variable org-structure-template-alist. See the docstring of the variable for additional details.
