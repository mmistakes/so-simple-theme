<p>I am the least gadget-whoring programmer that I know.  As proof, I submit this fact: my recently-deceased phone was an original, 2g iPhone.  It had become annoyingly slow recently, but I was not planning on forking over the cash to replace it.  But now, sadly, it has decided that the &ldquo;touch screen&rdquo; does not care about touch, and will just be a screen.</p>
<p>It has served me well, since the 2007 price drop a few months after launch.  </p>
<p>Now, bring on the shiny!</p>
