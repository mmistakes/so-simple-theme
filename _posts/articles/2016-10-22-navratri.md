Navratri is massive and extraordinary affair in Hindu religion, it is celebrated with great zeal and vigour across parts of India. 

The central theme of _Navratri_ is worshipping nine-forms of **Shakti** which help to restore and secure humans from evil forces.

>The victory of good over evil forces

The nine days of _Navratri_ are action packed, there are many events happening during this time like _lighting of auspicious joyth (lamp)_,
_vivid performance of garba, dandiya (astounding dancing patterns from Gujarat)_, _commemorating annual visit of the **Goddess** to her parents_. 
I'm sure you can imagine the hustle-bustle of _Navratri_.

Here I'm attempting to showcase Namma City's take on _Durga Puja_.  

# Places visited

## The Bengalee Association

Located at Ulsoor, the warmth of the _Bong Community_ is signature at this place. The pendal is situated over a big open space with ample of parking available.
_Bong Community_ makes sure that we feel like we are at _Bengal_ with all their festivity.

## Patel's Inn
Located at RT Nagar, its location is quite unique, because generally _Patel's Inn_ is synonyms with go karting but during _Navratri_ they host the abode of Durga.

## Rajarajeshwari Devi
Located at little far off central Bangalore at Rajarajeshwari Nagar, it is an ancient temple of **Durga**. 
Temple celebrates _Navratri_ by decorating the idol of **Durga** in different forms and also hosts **homas** (havans) during these nine days inside the temple area.

The temple is jam packed with devotees during this time.

# Our driving force â€” Food
I guess no celebrations at any part of world is ever complete without **food**, so _Navratri_ also is not an exception.
Let me take you through the food stalls that I came across during my visits to the pendals.

There are amazing non-veg delicacies from _Bengali pendals_, as you can see all of them where tantalising.
You can enjoy hot hot *luchi* (puri) with mutton, chicken or aloo curry, 
else you can take a dig at Bengali signature fish preparations like *ilish macher jhol*, *fish cutlet* or *prawns* these are hottest selling items.

Staggering big handis carrying fragrant *mutton biriyani* and big tawas for preparing *kathi rolls*, those aromas can drive you towards grabbing them.

You indeed have options for veg items too and counters serving *singhada (samosa)*, *puchka*, *chats* and *jalebi*.

Finally for digestion sake you can go for a *meetha pan*.

# Rock Show
_Bong's_ fetish with music is not a surprise and hence we have rock shows with full blown crew members rocking crowd with popular _Bengali_ numbers.
Did not understand them lyrically but nonetheless the numbers where sounding great.

# Intricate pendal decorations
Lavish and elaborate designs are used to decorate *Durga* idols and pedals, the passion of devotees can be gauged when you look at them.
I can bet, you would be spellbound and awestruck visiting them like myself.
