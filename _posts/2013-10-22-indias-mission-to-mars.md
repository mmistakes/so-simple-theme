Our neighbours over in India have a plan to launch a space mission to Mars.

> The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November.

Meanwhile in Pakistan we still concern ourselves with useless issues like what our [Northern province should be called][1]? Or to drop a letter from the [southern province][2] (LOLwut?), or who is allowed to say what in matters of religion like the [blasphemy law][3].

Let's disregard the high flying issues as space missions. We do as a nation have more pressing matters, like [power shortages][4], and [extreme poverty][5].

When will we as a nation stop keeping stupid notions of righteousness from doing what is important?
