So I have had some feedback from some of you who have read the recent posts (I know they are not a lot). And it has been most helpful.

Basic points that came out of the feedback are summarised as follows:

1. Injustice posts seem to be mostly rambling. I understand that these are first drafts that were mainly published to get feedback from you guys in the first place, but that does not excuse bad quality. 
2. Other stories I got most positive feedback and was encouraged to write more of that stuff. I hear ya' and will deliver.
3. Regular updates. I have not been posting on a regular schedule and will strive to make that happen. 

Just as an update of sorts, I tweeted recently:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Just noticed, in the past week I have written 11150 words. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23woah&amp;src=hash">#woah</a></p>&mdash; Naufal Mir (@Abijango) <a href="https://twitter.com/Abijango/statuses/395926265561362432">October 31, 2013</a></blockquote>

As I noted later, that doesn't mean much when it's not in publishable state (as per point 1. above). But I will clean it all up and try to publish it in smaller readable chunks.

For long for reading, I do recommend picking up a long-form reading services such as [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/), or [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/). Both have excellent mobile apps and are great for downloading long-form articles for reading offline.

Or as I do, link up my favourite reading websites to some RSS service, [Feedly](www.feedly.com) is an excellent service that is free and hooks up to almost all good RSS clients on mobile. I wrote an post about [RSS](http://abijango.com/rss-and-other-things/) before, do give it a read.
