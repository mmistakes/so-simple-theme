Acting as a kinetic skeleton, Hoberman rings give the pendant the ability to expand over a 300% dynamic range. Each ring is driven by a stepper motor and acts independently of the other rings of the stack. This uniquely controllable movement grants the pendant a range of kinetic animations like slow breathing, pulsing, or wave propagation. 

Just as the pendant's illumination reacts to its environment, the pendant's kinetics are also responsive to sound.

Building on basic Hoberman ring design, our linkage profile produces the maximum linkage footprint that avoids impinging on its neighbor.

Attaching the Hoberman ring to a gear train transforms the simple rotation of the stepper motor into a sinusoidal combination of expansion and torsion.  The animation above illustrates the stack's wave propagation.
