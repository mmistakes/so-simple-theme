Pairing two thousand addressable LEDs with sensors and the web, the pendant is aware of everything from local environments to twitter trends.

With a local weather API, the pendant brings the outside world indoors. Wake up with the sun and watch gray fog burn away as warm yellows wash over the pendant. An afternoon shower brings cool blue waves to the surface, and transitions to rich red sunset before the white moon rises. 

Directional microphones bring the pendant to life as it responds to music and conversation. 

The pendant's animations are driven with the mathematic underpinnings of the natural world. Harmonic pendulums fall in and out of phase, and gravitational orbits span the pendant's surface. Animated light grows and decays exponentially to mimic organic lifecycles.
