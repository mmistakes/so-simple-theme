help support Stan's future

# Contribute to the Stan Project

Stan is now linked to [NumFOCUS](http://numfocus.org/), a
U.S. 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that serves several other
open-source software projects, including NumPy, Julia, Jupyter, and
others.

Stan can now accept tax-deductible contributions through this
foundation. If you’re interested in contributing to Stan's ongoing
development, you may contact us directly or just follow the link:&nbsp;

<!-- 
10% of all donations go to support NumFOCUS and the rest goes directly
to support Stan development;  there is an additional 2.2% processing
fee from FlipCause.

## Why Support Stan?

Stan is a worthy cause: our software is free and, as users can attest,
we also give a lot of free and open help through the [users
list](/community/). We also have an active [developers list](/community/),
with contributors from many countries. By supporting Stan, your
organization is helping to make this state-of-the-art Bayesian data
analysis program even better. You’re pushing forward the frontiers of
science and helping your own work as well as others'.
