This week's meeting will happen at the same time and place.

We are, however, currently looking into finding a new location (and possibly day and time) for future meetings.
So if you plan to attend meetings, help us make an informed decision by filling out [this single-question poll](http://www.polljunkie.com/poll/zioiff/preferred-day-for-weekly-meetings) with the days you're availble.

You can also sign up on our [mailing list](https://lists.projectmeshnet.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nyc) to get any updates on meetings and the like.

__Please make sure to check the lower section of the cafe! There are stairs that go down behind where you order your coffee.__
