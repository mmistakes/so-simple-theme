We now have enough potential nodes in the east village and lower east side to form some kind of backbone for a mesh. We're going to meet at **1pm** at a member's apartment with our routers, check that we are properly configured, and then visit other member's rooftops and see if we can connect.

91 E 3rd St. #35<br>
New York, NY 10003<br>
