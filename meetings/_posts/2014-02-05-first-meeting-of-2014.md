Time for the first of our 2014 meetings! It will be an informal one at a cozy cafe in the Lower East Side.

Any topics or questions are up for discussion, but the goal of this meeting is to organize ourselves before we begin to make an effort
to attract more people across the boroughs (particularly where we already have members ready to setup nodes).

So whether you're ready to jump in or just have a few questions, stop by!
