The seventh meeting will be taking place at [xCubicle](http://www.xcubicle.com/), a local hackerspace in the Lower East Side.
Our new home also means a new meeting time: Tuesday at 7pm. So if you were unable to attend our previous meetings, I hope the
new time works.

If you plan to make it, please RSVP on the [Uniiverse page](https://www.uniiverse.com/listings/nyc-mesh-net-1st-meetup-xcubicle-tickets-new-york-city-1M846/1395788400).
If you share the event on Facebook or Twitter, the $5 RSVP fee will be waived. (For those worried,
you can target the appropriate friends on Facebook before it gets shared.)

Hope to see you all at the new time and place!
