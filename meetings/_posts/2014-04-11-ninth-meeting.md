Our next meeting will be on Tuesday, April 15th. [xCubicle](http://www.xcubicle.com/), the Lower East Side's
own hackerspace, has kindly agreed to host a meeting for a second time.

If you want to come and see what we're up to or you're just curious about meshnets
in general, stop by! We're a friendly bunch, I promise.
