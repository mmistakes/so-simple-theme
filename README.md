# So Simple Theme

Looking for a simple, responsive, theme for your Jekyll powered blog? Well look no further. Here be **So Simple Theme**, the followup to [**Minimal Mistakes**](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) -- by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com).

## So Simple Theme is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 9+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments and subtle animations. 
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Disqus comments if you choose to enable.
* Simple and clear permalink structure[^1].
* Tags for [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) for a better social sharing experience.
* Vanilla [custom 404 page]({{ site.url }}/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://mmistakes.github.io/articles/so-simple-theme/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.
* Simple search that overlays results based on post title.
* Grunt build script for easier theme development.
* [Sitemap](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/blob/master/sitemap.xml) for search engines

General notes and suggestions for customizing So Simple Theme.

---

## Basic Setup for new Jekyll site

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and read through the documentation if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [So Simple Theme repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/fork)
3. Clone the repo you just forked.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

[Download the Theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme)

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.

## Setup for Existing Jekyll site

1. Clone the following folders: `_includes`, `_layouts`, `assets`, and `images`.
