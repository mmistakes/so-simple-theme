## Basic Setup for new Jekyll site

1. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and then install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and all dependencies `bundle install`.
2. Fork the [So Simple Theme repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/fork).
3. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.
[Download the Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/archive/master.zip)

**Pro-tip:** Remove the sample posts in `_posts` and the `gh-pages` branch after cloning. There is a bunch of garbage in the `gh-pages` branch used for the theme's demo site.

## Setup for Existing Jekyll site

1. Clone the following folders: `_includes`, `_layouts`, `assets`, and `images`.
2. Clone the following files and personalize content as need: `about.md`, `articles.html`, `index.html`, `tags.html`, `feed.xml`, and `sitemap.xml`.
3. Set the following variables in your `config.yml` file:

``` yaml
title:            Site Title
description:      Site description for the metas.
logo:             site-logo.png
disqus_shortname: shortname
search:           true
# Your site's domain goes here. When working locally use localhost server leave blank
# PS. If you set this wrong stylesheets and scripts won't load and most links will break.
# PPS. If you leave it blank for local testing home links won't work, they'll be fine for live domains though.
