Stan is open source because we want your input to help make
Stan's code and documentation better.

Suggest or Discuss Code Patches
-------------------------------

To suggest or discuss small patches, such as localized bug fixes, the users group
is the best venue.  For larger patches, the discussion should move to
the developers group.

Contribute Code Patches
-----------------------

If you'd like to contribute code, please submit it through a Git
pull request.  The developer process for creating a Git pull request
is described on the Stan Wiki.

* [Developer Process Wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Developer-Process)
  <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>

After code review, testing, and merging, all code is distributed
under the same open-source license of the package to which it
belongs (GPL for RStan, PyStan; BSD for CmdStan, C++ API; CC
BY for documentation).

Contribute Models and Data
--------------------------

We're still discussing how to support user-contributed
models. The issues to sort out are:

* how to vet the models to make sure they work,
* how to handle intellectual property and licensing, and
* how to store and distribute them.

If you have suggestions, let us know on the users group.

Please feel free to discuss models and provide links and
references on the users group.

To Do List and Projects
-----------------------

Larger project design documents and goals, as well as the
developer process followed by Stan, are listed in various places on:

* [Stan Wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki)
  <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>

There is a top-level list that is in the process of being moved
over to the issue tracker.

* [To-Do List Wiki](https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/To-Do-List)
  <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>


Join the Development Team
-------------------------

The Stan development team is always looking for developers
willing to get their hands dirty with C++, R, or Python design,
coding, documentation, testing, and maintenance.

The current list of bugs and feature requests we would like to
implement is available on the [issue tracker](/development/).

If you'd like to join the development team and gain push access
to the Stan code repository, please let us know by first requesting
to join the [developers group](/contact/).
Please include a brief description of your programming background
and what you'd like to contribute.
